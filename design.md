Detecting a command
-------------------

The bot should *always* know how it is being talked to. Some commands may only
exist in certain input methods.

### Prefix
Probably want '!'. Should be easy to change though.

### Pre-highlights
*Must be at start (otherwise cmd could be hard to parse).* Probably treat the
same as prefix.

### Pre-pseudo-highlights
*Same as above.* Make some nicknames for roshanbot that are treated the same as
his actual nick.  Also potentially some fake nicks (e.g. "dota: item random" ->
dota) for speedier commands.

### Private message
Don't need prefix in this case.


Functions
---------

### RPS with privmsg cheating
So you can mess people up xD

### MUD / text adventure game
Would be cool.

### Dota voice responses
And aliases for them e.g. if it ever reads 'waifu', give cute CM response.
Should include link & quote, or just link. Use reddit account GitHub (TODO:
find).

### Dota items
Random or item name, give info.

### Hyperlinks
Just pretend to override Marvin or sth.
